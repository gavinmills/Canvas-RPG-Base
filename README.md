Canvas RPG Base
===============

Canvas base for making an RPG game

A *very* basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript game engine that can import Tiled JSON files and generate RPG-like levels.

Controls are very basic, just WASD. There is collision detection, again very basic.

Current known issues:

* Drawing the player sprite any other size than 32x64 can cause problems
* Movement is not time based
* Collision detection isn't perfect
* jQuery is old
* probably tons more
